1)The top five most used sources (app or site) to post or share a tweet. For each source return the 
number of posts and the number of users that created tweets from that source.

MATCH (s:Source)<-[:USING]-(t:Tweet)<-[:POSTS]-(u:User)
WITH s, COUNT(t) AS num_posts, COLLECT(DISTINCT u) AS list_user
RETURN s.displayName AS name_of_source, num_posts, SIZE(list_user) AS num_users
ORDER BY num_posts DESC
LIMIT 5;



2)Top 3 users that have the highest number of tweets with a retweetCount greater than 50. For each 
of these users show the number of popular tweets they have

MATCH (t:Tweet)<-[:POSTS]-(u:User)
WHERE t.retweetCount > 50
WITH  COUNT(t) AS num_pop_posts, u
ORDER BY num_pop_posts DESC
LIMIT 3
RETURN u.userName , num_pop_posts

3)The shortest path connecting the User ‘luckyinsivan’ and the hashtag ‘imsosick’ using any 
relationship type except :USING

MATCH path = shortestPath(
  (u:User {userName: 'luckyinsivan'})-[:MENTIONS | POSTS | CONTAINS | TAGS | RETWEETS *..50]-(h:Hashtag {text: 'imsosick'})
)
RETURN path;

4) Modification to Schema
MATCH (u:User)-[:POSTS]->(t:Tweet)-[:CONTAINS]->(l:Link)
WITH u, l
MERGE (u)-[:USES]-> (l)

MATCH (s:Source)<-[:USING]-(t:Tweet)
WITH s, t
MATCH (t)-[:CONTAINS]-> (l:Link)
WITH s, t, l
MERGE (s)-[:USES]-> (l)

5)Which users post the most links from linkedin, that is links from the domain "www.linkedin.com" or 
"lnkd.in"

MATCH (u:User)-[:USES]->(l:Link)
WHERE l.expandedUrl =~ '.*linkedin.*|.*lnkd\\.in.*'
WITH u, COUNT(l) AS linkCount
ORDER BY linkCount DESC
WITH COLLECT({user: u, count: linkCount}) AS userCounts, MAX(linkCount) AS maxLinks
UNWIND userCounts AS uc
WITH uc
WHERE uc.count = maxLinksRETURN COLLECT(uc.user.userName) AS user_names, uc.count AS num_posts;
