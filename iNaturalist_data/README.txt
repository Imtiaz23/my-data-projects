# This is a project on a subset of iNaturalist dataset
# Unfortunately, MLflow or similar functionalities were not used during experimentation
thus, Most of hyperparameter tuning endeavors are lost
# This Jupyter Notebooks showcase some of the drafts during working on this data
# Due to size limilation, actual images are not in this repository
# The csv files are given to make it easier to understand the structure of the dataset
# Some conventional ML models have been tried
Deep learning models include custom defined neural network
As well as transfer learning with resnet50, efficientnetV2, Mobilenetv2
# Fortunately, This project inspired a little article on Medium
